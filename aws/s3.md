## Simple Storage Service

- buckets could be private or public. files cannot be accessed by URL in browser
- only empty buckets can be deleted; empty bucket before deleting
- each object can be up to 5TB
  - 5GB per part, upload multi parts for larger files

### Security

- IAM policies, roles, users, groups
- bucket policies: bucket level
- Access control list (ACL): applied at bucket or object level

### Storage Class

- standard
- standard IA (infrequent access)
- standard one-zone IA
- intelligent tiering: no retrieval fee, auto move object between tiers
- object level config: single buckets can contain objects belonging to different tiers

### Glaciers

- 3 AZ, same as standard S3
- very infrequent access
- retrieval option: expedited (5 minutes), standard, bulk (5-12 hours)

### Lifecycle Management

- object deleted automatically after expiry time
- can archive to Glacier after expiry time

### Versioning

- version control to all objects in bucket
- each object can be restored to previous option
- can be restored if deleted by accident

### Cross Region Replication

- reduced latency for end users
- S3 enabled encryption replicated
- KMS encryption **not** replicaated
- need to copy objects to new region
- replication always takes place between a **pair** of AWS regions
- bucket can be source bucket for another cross region replication

### Amazon Macie

- use machine learning and pattern matching to discover security issues and sensitive data (PII), access control and encrypotion
- enabled per region
- generate **CloudWatch** events
